# 🏥 Healthcare Data Exploratory Analysis (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset to uncover insights related to patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital operations, and billing patterns.

The goal is to demonstrate real-world data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills using Python.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about:
- Patient age, gender, blood type  
- Medical conditions & medications  
- Admission and discharge dates  
- Admission types (Emergency, Urgent, Elective)  
- Hospitals & insurance providers  
- Billing amounts and test results  

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (Length of Stay, Age Groups)  
- Patient demographics analysis  
- Admission trends over time  
- Billing and revenue analysis  
- Condition-wise and admission-type-wise comparisons  
- Correlation analysis of numeric features

## 📈 Visualizations
Some of the visualizations included:
- Age distribution histogram  
- Monthly admission trends  
- Billing amount boxplot  
- Top hospitals by revenue  
- Length of stay by admission type  
- Test result distribution
